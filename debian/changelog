ultrabay-scripts (0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a check to always verify if the machine is actually a Thinkpad
    and is equipped with an UltraBay. 

  * Ensure proper checking in order to avoid and resolve broken installs
    of the former release. Sorry for the former inconvenience caused!

    ensure inclusion of changelog and README files.

    (un)plugging event to debian/postinst file to ensure suitable battery
    discharge priority is always set.

ultrabay-scripts (0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed thinkpad_check function from ultrabay_common file and all
    scripts using it. This check was too specific and unnecessarily
    excluded older Thinkpad models like the T23. Checking for the
    presence of a valid tp_smapi installation should be enough.

 -- Window Maker Live <wmlive@users.sf.net>  Thu, 21 Aug 2014 10:54:13 +0200

ultrabay-scripts (0.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

    the apt keyring in postint script, and removal of the same in postrm
    in case the package is purged from the system.

    ata_piix module, which is required for basic UltraBay functionality
    on various ThinkPad models.

ultrabay-scripts (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

    a verification of the /sys/class/dmi/id/product_version contents.
    Thanks again to linrunner for the hint.

ultrabay-scripts (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a short note to the control file and README.Debian regarding
    Thinkpads with an Ivy Bridge processor (X230, T430, T530, etc.) not
    being supported by tp-smapi, resulting in no battery threshold
    management being available via the ultrabay_battery script,

  * Added some preliminary, but not yet functional support for battery
    management via acpi_call and tpacpi-bat to both ultrabay_battery and
    ultrabay_common. Some user of a current Thinkpad with an Ivy Bridge
    CPU please help wth this.

  * Upon popular request, changed the '#!/bin/bash' shebang to POSIX
    conformant '#!/bin/sh'.

ultrabay-scripts (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revised test expression in functions "ultrabay_dock_interface ()"
    and "ultrabay_battery_interface ()" in ultrabay_common. Thanks to
    user dywi from www.thinkpad-forum.de for making me aware.

  * Moved the check for SMAPI from the ultrabay_battery script into a
    generic function "thinkpad_smapi_check ()" in ultrabay_common, and
    use this function instead in the script.

  * Included icons battery.png and cogwheels.png and modified icon path
    accordingly to a more generic /usr/share/icons/ in ultrabay_common,
    thus avoiding to rely on a user's ~/GNUstep/Library/Icons directory.

  * Override debhelper to only create start links with update-rc.d for
    init script, as a stop is never required.

 -- Window Maker Live <wmlive@users.sf.net>  Tue, 07 May 2013 00:35:33 +0200

ultrabay-scripts (0.5-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the rather dangerous umount procedure from ultrabay_eject.
    Better leave that to a human sysadmin to manage.

  * Added a check in ultrabay_eject, verifying if the device is still in
    use and quit with an informative error message if it's still busy.

  * Modified messages in ultrabay_eject, while at the same time getting
    rid of superfluous duplicate desktop notifications.

  * Do not overwrite already existing udev rules file during postinst.
